# Beginning Application Development with ASP.NET Core

While .NET has long been popular in the enterprise, it was traditionally for Windows environments only. The new .NET Core is open-source, cross-platform and optimized for applications that live in the cloud and communicate with mobile devices. Because of this, the .NET platform is now applicable to more scenarios and a broader base of developers who utilize open source in their web stacks.Â This makes a need for training in this area, even if you are experienced with ASP.NET.

This is a starter class on Microsoft's new cross-platform development platform - ASP.NET Core.  We will build something functional using production-grade practices, covering all the basics in order to get an application ready for deployment, including building a skeleton application, adding needed configuration, adding some features, and getting it deployed.

You can use any platform, since the development experience in ASP.NET Core is about the same on Windows, Mac or Linux. You can also use Docker, which is highly recommended since ASP.NET Core works seamlessly with it and it's fast becoming common for development and deployment.

You should come away from this course with a solid foundation in ASP.NET Core development, ready to dive in deeper, with a base understanding of the architecture, lifecycle and caveats of this exciting new open-source platform. You should also be able to provide your organization with insights on when and if you should upgrade or use ASP.NET Core on your next project. [I THINK THIS IS AMBITIOUS FOR 1 DAY]

## Objectives

* Gain an understanding of web applications built in ASP.NET Core
* Gain an understanding of the new application lifecycle and what's under the hood
* Learn the CLI-oriented development process that works the same on Windows, Mac or Linux
* Build an application from scratch, learning about each aspect of the infrastructure, from the internal Kestrel server to middleware to the DI containers used internally.
* Access databases using Entity Framework Core
* Create RESTful Web API services to be consumed by a front-end
* Set up a simple front-end to work with our ASP.NET Web API backend
* Basics of MVC & server-side rendering (lecture only, demos, no coding)
* Understand the basic deployment options and operations for an ASP.NET Core application * (demo)
* Getting started with automated testing (demo with dotnet test)

## Who Should Attend

ASP.NET developers who haven't built anything in ASP.NET Core will learn the new architecture, lifecycle and key APIs to be productive and get an application production-ready.

You don't need ASP.NET experience since we'll be starting from the beginning of the ASP.NET Core subject matter, however we will not cover C# concepts, so familiarity with those is recommended but should not be required if you are proficient with another statically-typed programming language such as Java.
